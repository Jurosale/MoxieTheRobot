Moxie is an AI-driven robot designed to help children improve their social skills through play-based learning. As a developer in a small, indie company with a cross-disciplinary team, I got to work on and own a variety of our systems using various platforms and programming languages. The files in this repository are a small sample of my overall work and files of different languages, systems and complexities were selected to more accurately showcase my range of responsibilities. Certain files contain "README" comments to distinguish helpful comments for viewers from development comments. All files are my work unless explicitly stated in a "README" comment at the top of the file.
